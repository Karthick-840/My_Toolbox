PDF Operations
===========

PDF documents are ubiquitous in professional settings. Tasks such as combining research papers, dissecting lengthy reports, or extracting specific page ranges are common but often time-consuming. This tool aims to simplify these operations and provide a foundation for more advanced PDF interactions.

## Overview

This module provides functionalities to access, extract, and manipulate PDF files. It includes the following components:

1. **PDF_Access**: List and read PDF files in a directory.
2. **PDF_Extract**: Extract text, tables, and images from PDF files.
3. **PDF_Manipulate**: Merge, split, and move PDF files.

<h3>Core Functionalities</h3>

* **Splitting PDFs & Merging PDFs** Merge multiple PDFs into a single document, either in alphabetical order or a prescribed order. Also, Split a PDF into individual pages or specific page ranges.
* **Removing Blank Pages:** Streamline PDFs by eliminating unnecessary blank pages.
* **Custom Page Extraction:** Extract specific pages or page ranges from a PDF to create new documents.

 **_NOTE:_**  While these features establish a solid base, the long-term vision for PDF manipulation extends beyond simple document restructuring. The integration of advanced language models like Llama 3 or xAI's Grok is envisioned to enable users to interact with PDFs in a conversational manner, extracting information, modifying content, or generating summaries through natural language prompts.

 <h3>Future Enhancements</h3>

* **Interactive PDF Editing** 
* **Intelligent Document Organization:** Automatically categorize and tag PDFs based on content, metadata, and usage patterns.
